    "4. For each pair of cities/airports, determine how the daily change of temperature high and precipitation from one city predicts the daily change of the other city 1, 3, and 7 days in advance.\n",
    "5. Plot the correlation strengths for the 10 top pairs for all three dates for temperature and precipitation (separately) as a function of distance. Also, make a plot as a function of longitude. What trends do you see?"
