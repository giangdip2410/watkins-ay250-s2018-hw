# HW 6 README

The file `hw_6_assignment.ipynb` contains the function used to extract image features, the code used to train the model, metrics used to estimate model performance, and code that can be used to run the classifier on a validation dataset.

The last two cells should be used to run the classifier on a validation dataset. The path specified in the last cell should be changed to point to the directory the contains the validation dataset. 

**NOTE**: Before running the last two cells, make sure to run the first two cells, so that the image extraction function `extractImageFeatures` can be used on the validation dataset. If this is not done, you will run into an error.
