    "1. Download the [zip file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cst9awcjpp08k33/50_categories.tar.gz). Look at some of the images, noting that there are 50 classes in 4244 images (e.g. \"goldfish\", “llama”, “speed-boat”, ...). Caution: it’s a pretty large file (~208M).\n",
    "2. Write a set of methods that takes as input one of these images, and then computes real-numbered features as the return. You should produce at least 15 features.\n",
    "3. Based on the feature set for each image, build a random forest classifier. Produce metrics on your estimated error rates using cross-validation. How much better is this than the expectation with random guessing? What are the 3 most important features?\n",
    "4. Make sure your final classifier can run on a directory of different images, where a call like `run_final_classifier(\"/new/directory/path/\")` on directory that contains files like `validation1.jpg`, `validation2.jpg`, etc. will produce an output file that looks like:  \n",
